# Resonator-Quality-Factor
Extrapolate quality factor for micro-wave resonators from scattering matrix data
Calculates the
- Resonance frequency
- Total Quality Factor
- Coupling Quality Factor
- Intrinsic Quality Factor

see "Demo.py" for usage examples

this module has two classes:
"Measurement" class to handle a single data file and do all calculations
"Resonator" class, you can assign many different measurements of the same resonator and easily plot different attributes
